# Markov Trading Simulation
A Markov chain, or Markov process, is a stochastic model that describes a sequence of possible events.
The key property is that the future state depends only on the current state and not on the past states. This can be formalized as:

$P(X_{n+1}|X_n,X_{n-1},...,X_1) = P(X_{n+1}|X_n)$

where $X_n$ represents the state at time $n$.

The goal of this project is to develop a simple Markov trading model using historical stock price data and simulate the strategy's potential market returns by deploying a web application that anyone can use.
